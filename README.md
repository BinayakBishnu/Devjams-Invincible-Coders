# Develop an application that can recognize gestures such as swipe up, swipe down, swipe left, swipe right, and grab and allow the user to control their computer by automating the mouse and keyboard using the gestures.

We have made a motion controlled interface for a computer. It consists of a dashboard where a user can select different types of features using their finger whether they want to use the virtual mouse or the virtual keyboard. Then they can control the mouse or keyboard using their palms.\
It has been implemented using python as the programming language, opencv and mediapipe.\
Such a  motion controlled interface allows touchless interaction with a computer. A potential application of such a system is touchless kiosks in public areas which would especially useful in todayâ€™s COVID times.
